## Abstract
After we manipulated and analized the data, we came to the conclusion that ______ is the best neighborhood around Pittsburgh. In summary, we took into account the general safety of the neighborhoods by using a Public Safety metric as well as a Fire Incident metric. For the Public Safety metric, we weighted the severity of the crimes and added them up for each neighborhood. For the Fire Incidents, we totalled all the fire incidents in each neighborhood, then manipulated its graph using multiple methods. Finally, to find what neighborhood was the best, we took the weighted average of our analysis of the Public Safety and Fire Incident metrics and combined them. The result with the lowest total (Safety and Fire) was the best neighborhood. Thus, ______ is the best neighborhood.
